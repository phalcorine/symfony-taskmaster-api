# Task Master (Symfony) Backend API

A task management backend API built using Symfony 5 and PHP 8.0.

A flutter mobile application consumes this API. The source code can be found here: https://github.com/phalcorine/flutter-taskmaster-mobile

## Getting Started

Here are a list of features / user stories I intend to implement.

### DONE:
- A user should be able to create a new account.
- A user should be able to login to an existing account.
- A user should be able to view a list of his/her tasks.
- A user should be able to add a new task.
- A user should be able to view the details of a task.
- A user should be able to edit a task.
- A user should be able to delete a task.

### TODO:
- [URGENT] Prepare API Documentation!
- A user should be able to set a due-date for a task.
- Research possibilities of implementing Push Notifications (SSEs, WebSockets, etc).
- Still thinking of something...

### IDEAS:
- A task can have checklists?
- A project feature to organize related tasks?
- A team feature where a user can:
	- create a team.
	- invite other users to the team
	- manage invites
	- manage team members
	- create a projects and assign users to tasks within the project
